### Explain microservices in your own understanding
 • In my own understanting, mircoservices are different parts of a body that perform different functions to keep me alive when you look at the whole. Each body part - ie lung is separated(micro service) with its own microparts- alveoli, bronchioles ( databases and servers) and communicate with each other using the blood vessels(the REST API framework) to ensure the body and other organs work (application works)


### Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?
• At this point, I think Microservices architecture appeals to me as I would like to understand the infrastructure and any development overheads that come with building, scaling and deploying an application. As I grow in this, I would like to explore serverless architecture after gaining an indepth understanding of microservice architecture. 


### Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?
•  Node.js is not a multithreaded language.It is a single-threaded event-driven runtime environment that uses an event loop to handle operations and callbacks in a non-blocking way.Node.js however supports multithreading through the use of worker threads(a way to create and manage additional threads in Node.js)


### What does REPL stand for?
• Read-Eval-Print-Loop.
